**Odin Recipes**

This is my very first project from The Odin Project. 

It's a very basic recipe website, there are links to three recipes with images, description, ingredients and steps needed to cook them.

The three recipes are in an unordered list on the website.

This was a fun first project to test things i've learned in html.
